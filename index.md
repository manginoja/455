## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/manginoja/455/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Summary
### Problem Setup
This model was made to be submitted to the Kaggle competition “Birds! Are they real?”.  The goal of this competition was to create a model that can classify bird species using the provided images and labels.  The model was then tested on a pre-defined dataset provided through the Kaggle competition, under the folder /test/.  The goal of this model was to provide the highest testing accuracy on this dataset.
