This project just consisted of one ResNet model, found in ResNet.ipynb.  (Apologies for the annoying notebook output clogging the page.)

The file "birds4.pth" mentioned in the notebook contains the weights for the model to perform at the best achieved testing accuracy. However, Github wouldn't allow me to upload a file of that size.
